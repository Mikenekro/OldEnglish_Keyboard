Replaces keyboard keys with Old English characters when enabled


To install:
1. Run OEKeySetup.exe

2. Follow on screen instructions

NOTE: The Old English Keyboard is not confined to the main program window. Typing in any text area on the screen will work as long
as the Old English Keyboard is opened and enabled, and the correct modifier+key combo is being pressed.

NOTE: While the keyboard is enabled, you can continue typing with normal characters. If you wish to assign a basic combo to type an
Old English character, set the 'Modifier Key'. Then hold the Modifier key + the specified key to type.


Instructions:
Using the Old English Keyboard is simple and straighforwwrd. When the program is running, the first line displays a key combo
that you can press to enable the Special Characters used in Old English. The current Enable/Disable combo is 'CTRL + P'.

  Indicator text will be just above the 'Enable' and 'Disable' buttons. This text will let you know if you can use the characters
from the 'Key' column.


- Description -
The Old English Keyboard is a small project for use as a quick way to type in Old English while I am learning the language.
More features will probably be added on as I gain more experience with Old English or from any tips on what would be useful 
to add.


- Toggles Area -
The 'Toggles' section holds special cases for the characters. These changes will be displayed by each OE Characters
representation in the 'Key' section. For instance, pressing 'T' with the 'Special Uppercase' toggle off will result in
a lowercase Thorn 'þ', while enabling the 'Special Uppercase' toggle will result in an uppercase Thorn 'Þ'.


- Key Area -
The 'Key' area displays each special character that we can easily type and the keys needed to type that character. Currently, 
there is no function to change the default keys but we can change the 'Modifier' key by selecting a Modifier from the dropdown
list above the Key Area. 

  To enter one of the characters into a text field, just hold the modifier and press the corresponding key when the keyboard is enabled. 
If no modifier is used (a value of 'None'), just press the key over any text field.

  Any changes that affect an item in the Key Area will be reflected within this group immediately. 


- Modifier Key -
The 'Modifier Key' is used to section off when a character will be replaced. If there is no modifier (value of 'None') and the
keyboard is enabled, any key used by a special character will be replaced with the corresponding character.

  If the keyboard is disabled or there is a modifier key, the original character will be used until the keyboard is enabled
or the modifier key is held down.

  For instance: If the keyboard is disabled and you type in 'T' for Thorn, the text area will output 'T'. If the keyboard is enabled
and has a Modifier Key of 'Control', holding 'CTRL' and pressing 'T' will output 'þ'.


- Test Keyboard Area -
This text area can either be used as the main area for typing in Old English or it can be used to test a few characters while
getting used to the layout and style needed for typing. 

  If you wish to save the text you have written, you can go to 'File->Save As' to save the text in this area to a text file.
